<h2>First Annual YAPC::NA Robot Challenge</h2>

<p>
These days, most everyone knows about Perl's power and flexibility when it comes to large-scale data munging, online publishing, and back-office integration. Fewer know about its long history as a language-of-choice for <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&source=hp&q=perl+home+automation&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=CgyqRv_WYTNjBNZmMhQTyg8GFDAAAAKoEBU_Q7vx0&pbx=1&fp=3790a74a01e4e5b1">home automation</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&safe=off&q=perl+robotics&aq=f&aqi=g1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&pbx=1&fp=48cc2ad2e576e17a">robotics</a>. Spurred on by advances in home robotics and events like the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2010/">Maker Faire</a>, a new generation of hardware hackers is rising up and many of them are discovering that Perl's power, flexibility, and ubiquity make it a natural fit for those times when their project needs a little something extra.
</p>

<p>
With the explicit goal of fostering more creative cross-pollination and innovation between the Perl community and hardware geeks of all stripes, we are proud to announce the First Annual YAPC::NA Robot Challenge.
</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>

<p>
This iteration of the YAPC::NA Annual Robot Challenge will be a motorsports-style race. Teams will consist of one or more people (ideally 3-4), plus an expert provided by the organizers. Teams will build and program a hands-off radio-controlled vehicle to navigate a course based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TG_Test_Track.PNG">track used for speed trials</a> on the popular BBC television series Top Gear. Each team will participate in two (three?) solo heats, the combined qualifying times for each team will be used to sort them into smaller groups for the final divisional races. In the divisional races, teams will compete head-to-head against one another in a first-past-the-post race. Prizes will be awarded to to the top three teams in each division, along with special-mention prizes for creativity, the "most Perlish" solution, etc.

<p>[More Detailed Rules Needed]</p>

<h3>Event Structure</h3>

<p>
The schedule of events is largely to be determined (and will depend greatly on the number of teams) but, roughly, things will follow the standard R/C motorsports model:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Opening Ceremonies</li>
<li>Solo qualifying runs</li>
<li>Entertainment/Track Reset Break</li>
<li>Division B Final</li>
<li>Division A Final</li>
<li>Awards Ceremony</li>
<li>Closing Ceremonies</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Logistics and Technical Nitty-Gritty</h3>

<p>
Basic logistics comprise a flat, paved area near the hotel with sufficient room to contain the track, teams' hacking/construction tables, wi-fi broadcast antenna, servers, camera equipment, and throngs of happy race fans. Space will be set aside for vendors (food and beverages, in addition to any companies with products or services that fit the event theme). If the race venue is not directly adjacent to the hotel (the ideal case), consideration must be given to equipment transportation, shuttles, etc.
</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>

<p>
The YAPC::NA Robot Challenge is a new event and very much still in its planning stages. Your sponsorship-- in the form of financial support, donated hardware, volunteered expertise, etc-- can have a defining impact. Recognition of notable sponsors will be a key part of the event's media outreach and priority will be given to those individuals, companies, and organizations who get on board early. If you're interested in contributing, please send a quick message to <a href="mailto:sponsors@yapc2011.us">sponsors@yapc2011.us</a> to start the conversation.
</p>

<h3>Can I Form A Team?</h3>

<p>Yes! Team registration is now open. Drop a note to <a href="mailto:robotchallenge@yapc2011.us">robotchallenge@yapc2011.us</a> to get the ball, and your awesome Perl-powered robot car, rolling.</p>
